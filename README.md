## Latest Event: AI/ML Workshop at MIT-WPU (April 20, 2025)

### Exploring the Future: AI/ML Workshop at MIT World Peace University

Today, we had the incredible opportunity to host our AI/ML workshop at MIT World Peace University, bringing together students, professionals, and AI enthusiasts from across Pune. The workshop focused on practical applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence using Google's cutting-edge technologies.

Our speakers covered a range of topics from the fundamentals of machine learning to advanced implementations of Google's AI tools. Participants got hands-on experience with TensorFlow, explored the capabilities of Gemini AI, and learned how to integrate machine learning models into their applications.

The interactive sessions allowed students to work on real-world problems, with mentors providing guidance throughout the process. The enthusiasm and engagement from the MIT-WPU students was truly inspiring!

We want to thank MIT World Peace University for hosting us, all our speakers for sharing their knowledge, and everyone who attended for making this event a success. The questions and discussions that emerged during the workshop showed the vibrant AI community developing in Pune.

Stay tuned for resources from today's workshop, which will be uploaded to this repository soon.
